## 🎨 Theme Structure

Themes are defined using CSS variables in `globals.css`. Each theme is a class applied to the `<html>` element.

Example:

```css
:root[data-theme='blue-light'] {
  --background: #f8fafc;
  --foreground: #0f172a;
  --primary: #1e40af;
  --secondary: #e0e7ff;
  /* ... more variables */
}
```

We support the following themes:

* `theme-blue-light`
* `theme-blue-dark`
* `theme-red-light`
* `theme-red-dark`
* `theme-chrono-light`
* `theme-chrono-dark`

---

## 🌓 Theme Switching

We use `next-themes` for dynamic theme switching. To change theme:

```tsx
import { useTheme } from "next-themes";
const { setTheme } = useTheme();
setTheme("theme-blue-dark");
```

> The selected theme will persist in `localStorage` and be restored on page load.
